            <p>You might saw me jumping, climbing buildings, and stopping trains. But nobody pays me a dime for that
                work.
                That's why I am learning and mastering web development. I will not stop until I become the Web
                Development
                Hero.</p>
            <p>A thesis statement is a declarative sentence that asserts the position a paper will be taking. This
                statement should be both specific and arguable. Generally, the thesis statement will be placed at the
                end of the first paragraph of your paper. The remainder of your paper will support this thesis.</p>

                demonstrates his/her accomplishments. The collection is a marketing tool aimed at potential employers
